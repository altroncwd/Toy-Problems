# Toy Problems
The purpose of this repository is to have a place to post up my solutions for toy problems.  These problems are questions that have been asked at interviews and problems to help challenge oneâ€™s JS knowledge.  Problems will be found from multiple sources and should be updated during weekdays.

# The Problem
All prompts to questions will be stated at the beginning in a commented out section.  It should provide the basic question and information on the basic format of the answer.  Limited Examples should be provided.

# The Solution
I will be providing my own solution to these answers which should work in the context of the provided question.  Solutions do not necessarily cover all edge cases in a real world implementation however should show the basic logic and understanding of how to approach a problem.  I prefer legible code over clever code, and will sometimes provide comments explaining my thought process.

# Want to share your solution?
Feel free to share your own solutions to questions, I'd love to hear see them.  Simply fork the repository, pull down a copy, and add your solution after my own, and in between a commented section.
```

Thanks for your time, I hope this helps someone :D
